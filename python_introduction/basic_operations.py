# This program performs basic arithmetic operations

# Step 1: Define two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Step 2: Perform the calculations
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2

# Step 3: Print the results
print('Addition of', number1, 'and', number2, 'is', addition)
print('Subtraction of', number1, 'and', number2, 'is', subtraction)
print('Multiplication of', number1, 'and', number2, 'is', multiplication)
