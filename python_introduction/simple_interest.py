# This program calculates simple interest

# Step 1: Define the values
principal = 1000   # The starting amount
rate = 0.05        # 5% interest rate
time = 3           # 3 years

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest using the formula
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the result
print('The simple interest is:', interest)
